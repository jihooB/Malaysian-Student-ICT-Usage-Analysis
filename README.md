Analysis of Primary Students' ICT Usage for Learning in Malaysia

This project performs an econometric analysis of the factors influencing computer usage among primary school students in Malaysia for educational purposes. 
By utilizing Logit and Probit models, the study identifies how demographic characteristics and UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) variables impact students' ICT engagement.


[Key TakeawaysModel Performance: ]
  * The Logit model achieved the best fit with an accuracy of 63.68%, determined by comparing AIC, BIC, and McFadden’s $R^2$ values.
    
  * Performance Expectancy (PerfExp): Identified as the most significant driver.
    
  * Students' internal motivation and belief in the utility of ICT are crucial for frequent use.
    
  * Digital Divide: A clear disparity exists between urban and rural locations, with urban students consistently showing higher predicted probabilities of computer use regardless of gender or allowance.
    
  * Social Influence: Support and encouragement from family (SI.Family) play a vital role in increasing the likelihood of ICT adoption in learning.
